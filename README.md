The official JETCO website for finding ATMs (https://www.jetco.com.hk/en/atm/atm-locator) is abysmal, so we scrape the data through an open JSON API every 20 minutes to not only get the raw data, but to see the changes over time. 

This does not mean that the data is clean. You can see the current map of ATMs here [and feel free to compare it to the official ATM finder]: https://publicdatamarket.com/jetcoatms/jetcoatms?longitude__lt=200 Click "load all" to see all the ATMs. As can be seen, this does still not show _all_ ATMs in the dataset, as at the time of writing 7 ATMs have no location (latitude and longitude) information, and 1 ATM has a longitude of 113547978.0, which might be on the moon.
